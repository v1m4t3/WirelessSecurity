## WiFi Lab Report
The goal of this experiment was to test the goodput in three different network scenarios: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi with an antenna placed in saltwater.
The main goal was to predict the expected results beforehand by calculating the maximum theoretical goodput (TMG) and then compare these predictions with the actual test result
