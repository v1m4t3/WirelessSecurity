\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% The analysis of the different scenarios clearly shows that wired network transmission maintains a high level of stability. The simplicity of the setup and the use of Ethernet cables allow for accurate theoretical estimations of goodput, as the variables involved are limited and controllable. At the same time, it is clear how this significantly changes when moving to wireless communication. The wide range of technologies and protocols available in 2025 makes it challenging to obtain precise theoretical estimates of goodput, and even after conducting additional analyses, computeing accurate predictions remains complex.  
% Finally, we observed how highly variable environments like saline water make empirical evaluations the only reliable approach.

% In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering transmission environment characteristics and device specifications to obtain realistic goodput estimations, especially for wireless and unconventional communication scenarios.

Despite our computations being somewhat approximative, we can still extract valuable insights.
Wired networks offer stable transmission, allowing accurate goodput estimations due to controlled variables. In contrast, wireless communication introduces complexity, making precise theoretical predictions challenging, because of the wide range of technologies of 2025. Finally, empirical evaluation remains essential, particularly in highly variable environments like saline water.
