\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:relwork}
In~\secref{sec:intro} you talked about the project at a very high-level. This is
the section from where you will start giving details. First with things that are
already done, and familiarize the reader with background information they will
need to understand you work. 


\paragraph{Threat model.}
Often this section you will discuss the threat-model, but there is no strict consensus on that. 


Here is how you cite papers. For example, we read papers in the
class~\cite{rahul2016pwtypos,dodisetal:2004}.  And here is some random citation~\cite{Bojinov:2010:KLP,schechter:2010:pen,everspaugh2015pythia,bellare2009format,Juels:2014}


\subsection{Overview of the design}
\label{sec:overview}

And then just to showoff some \LaTeX skills, here is a Tikz plot.
\input{images/mainflow.tex}

You refer to a figure in the following way. In~\figref{fig:mainflow} we show
some thing that is relevant for the Multisketch paper by Chatterjee et
al.~\cite{chatterjee2019multisketches}. Add your bibliography to the
\textsf{bib.bib} file. You can copy the Bibtex format citation from Google
Scholar.
