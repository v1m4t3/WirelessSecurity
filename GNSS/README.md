## GNSS Lab Report

The goal of our experiments was to collect GNSS data by means of Googleâ€™s GNSSLogger Android app and then analyze them to see how different conditions impact signal integrity and positioning accuracy. 
To do so, we analyzed both raw measurements and the PVT solutions found using the method of WLS
We started with data collection in open-sky conditions and later simulated a cyber-spoofing scenario where we alter pseudoranges and apply artificial time delays using the same MATLAB tools. 
Ultimately, we studied how biological materials attenuate GNSS signals, by using pork meat as a proxy for human tissue.
