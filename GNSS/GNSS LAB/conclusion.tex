\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our experiments revealed how GNSS signal quality and positioning accuracy rely on hardware conditions as well as outside interference. We successfully emulated cyber-spoofing attacks, at the same time demonstrating both its effects and its limitations.

Our last experiment showed the substantial impact of biological attenuation on signal reception and highlighted the distinction between accuracy and precision in GNSS systems.
